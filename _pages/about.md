My name is Peng Yong, a postdoc researcher at [SEISCOPE](https://seiscope2.osug.fr/), Université Grenoble Alpes. 
My expertise lies in high-resolution seismic imaging. I obtained my BSc (2014) and PhD (2019) degrees in 
exploration geophysics from [China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://www.upc.edu.cn/). 
During October 2016 to September 2017, I visited the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the 
[University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/).
  

My research utilizes **finite difference** and **spectral element** methods for wavefield extrapolation. 
My primary focus is on tackling challenges in **full-waveform inversion**, including **local minima** issues in velocity 
reconstruction, **cross-talk** issues in multi-parameter inversion, and **uncertainty analysis** of inversion results. 
I have worked on the following projects:
   - 2019.10–present
     - Q estimation by FWI: analysis and method development
     - Mitigating local minima in FWI using a local matching filter
     - Parsimonious truncated Newton method for time-domain FWI
   - 2014.09–2019.07
     - Application of optimal transport to FWI and LSRTM
     - Total variation regularization for high-contrast salt body inversion
     - Elastic RTM using decoupled wave equation and inner product imaging condition
     - Acoustic and elastic waveform modeling using an optimized SGFD method
   - 2013.09–2014.07
     - Acoustic and elastic wave modeling with SGFD method on discontinuous grids

During my leisure time, I take pleasure in activities such as football, hiking, and cycling.
