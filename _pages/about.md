My name is Peng Yong, a postdoc researcher at [SEISCOPE](https://seiscope2.osug.fr/), Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. 
My expertise lies in seismic waveform inversion and modeling. I obtained my BSc (2014) and PhD (2019) degrees in 
exploration geophysics from [China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://www.upc.edu.cn/). 
During October 2016 to September 2017, I visited the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the 
[University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/).
  

My research utilizes **finite difference** and **spectral element** methods for wavefield extrapolation. 
My primary focus is on tackling challenges in **full-waveform inversion**, including **local minima** issues in velocity 
reconstruction, **cross-talk** issues in multi-parameter inversion, and **uncertainty analysis** of inversion results.
